f1(theta): completes function for problem 1. Has 2 roots  
f4(theta): used for problem 4. has 4 roots.  
graph2(): completes problem 2, graphs f1(theta) for theta=(-pi,pi)  
graph4(): provides visualization for problem 4. graphs f4(theta) on (-pi,pi)  
plot3_1(): plots figure 1.15(a)  
plot(3_2(): plots figure 1.15(b)  
plot4(r): plots problem 4 for each r=1,2,3,4 for the 4 roots  
plotany(b1,b2,b3,v1,v2,v3): plots a stewart platform with bases b1,b2,b3 and vertices v1,v2,v3. all variables ar array of size 2
